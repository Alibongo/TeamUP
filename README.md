# WDI_TEAM_PROJECT
Team Byte Project

ISSUES
- budget sliders
- project show: based on show/update/apply discussion:
single show page - depending on who is logged in, will say apply or nothing
The project edit page is for lead FL only to update the team(and other details?)
- landing page links
- landing page card persists to projectsNew1

STILL TO DO:
Front end authentication
controllers and functions for each state/page (will need protected routes to be disabled)
